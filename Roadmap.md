# Roadmap
Design for the protocol began sometime in september 2022, on December 01 2022 it had reached a point I found satisfactory (though some amendments are still being made).
The short and long form of the whitepaper will be released on January 03 2023, coinciding with the launch date of the original Bitcoin protocol. 

Fundraiser NFTs are currently being developed along with medium articles and a youtube video explaining in intricate detail along with demo screenshots what the protocol
would look like and how it would function. 
The various visual elements and promotional images are being created. 
The NFT fundraiser would be hosted on Ethereum due to its high liquidity and ease of use. 

Funds would first be used to develop what I call "HYPR" or Hydra Protection, HYPR is the bedrock on which everything else rests, it is what allows Peng to avoid the
trappings of cryptographic security that winds up creating a layer 2 system. 
An "affiliate network of bots" would then be created, this network in itself does not appear impactful on the surface level, but should Peng succeed I will flesh it out 
further. 
Thirdly the scripting framework/market maker bots would need to be put together. 
Once Peng(a) comes to fruition, I would then look to create Peng(r) which is simply an SDK that allows for the creation of additional systems on top of Peng(a), similar
to creating smart contracts but with heavy restrictions to prevent mismanagement. 

A version of Peng would then be created on BitcoinSV, because BitcoinSV and BitcoinCash are so similar it would be easier to port over work from one to the other. 
The final hurdle is creating Peng(o), which is a version of Peng designed to work around the slow block time and relatively high transaction costs of Bitcoin SegWit.
