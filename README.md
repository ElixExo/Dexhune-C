# Introduction 
Dexhune is a crypto token system built on Avalanche C-Chain, it is designed to enable the creation of price pegged assets via a new form of 'Distributed' Exchange. The system achieves stable pricing through a base token called "DXH", which subsequent listed tokens are either pegged to directly or at parity. The price of DXH is enforced on all trades in the Exchange Smart Contract. This value is gotten from the 'Price DAO'.
