# Peng-Protocol
Peng Protocol is a blockchain interoperable non-cryptographic solution, in simple words; this means it is not a blockchain but rather an immutable webapp oriented towards transactions. This is the "Hybrid-Line-Bus" which is immutable and scales infintely based on the capacity of nodes in the network. 

# Hybrid Line Network 
The Hybrid line Network is a hybrid setup where nodes connect to the network linearly, meaning they can only have one "child connection" and one "parent connection", the oldest node in the line is called a "root", which has no parent. Nodes communicate with each other about database states and transactions taking place. For consensus to be achieved all actions must be checked and approved by the current root node, actions outside this are considered delinquency and the delinquent node is kicked from the network. Counter measures against root delinquency are as follows; child nodes can break off from a delinquent root and attempt "re-discovery", the valid root is determined by the "formal website" which is hosted on IPFS as an immutable object, the Formal Website routes client requests to the network, therefore the Formal Website is the arbitrator of the network.
