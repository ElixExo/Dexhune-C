# Peng-Protocol
# Introduction
Peng Protocol proposes a way to create liquid tokens on Bitcoin Segwit, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV by using DRM (Digital Rights Management), 
distributed market makers, and OP_Return transactions.

Peng Market makers are like intermediaries, what the user is doing is issuing a ledger update, but to prevent mismanagement they are limited by the market 
makers, market makers also make it easier to read these entries by providing a blockchain explorer of all valid Peng ledger entries stored on the blockchain. 
All Peng Transactions have "proofs" which are digital signatures signed by the wallet that initiated the transaction. 
Peng is fully on Layer 1 with no additional blockchain. The purpose of DRM is to prevent tampering on the node operator side. The "ledger entries" are 
OP_Return transactions. 
These [NFTs](https://medium.com/@genericmage1127/peng-nft-design-5607b9fefe1d) are a fundraising measure; they are Pengs in unusual places.
