# Peng-Protocol
Peng Protocol is a series of proposed Blockchain interoperable systems which aim to enhance existing consensus mechanisms either through on-chain applications or immutable off-chain systems. 
# Hybrid Line Network 
The Hybrid line Network is the second iteration of the first proposed application, which functions external to any Blockchain system. More information about the proposed network can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zIHSdoCiDXmMnENdjWEAzlSOWcRqMN_d/view?usp=share_link)

# Design Proposals

# Dexhune Distributed Exchange 
Dexhune is a pilot system for Peng Protocol, which inherits many of the same security and trading concepts of the Hybrid Line proposals but built on a much simpler platform; the EVM. The Dexhune whitepaper can be found [Here](https://files.catbox.moe/78mg6x.pdf)
